  <h1>Orb.Farm vs 7 Poems: Interaction Design Analysis</h1>
  <h2>UI research project – S4109866</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Information Design</h3>

    <h4>Orb.Farm</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> The state of the ecosystem is communicated primarily through colour (eg. green for algae, tan for sand, blue for water), size (all materials are small but distinct shapes and movement), and proximity (clusters = relationships).</li>
      <li><strong>Design Principle:</strong> Leverages visual hierarchy: elements that change attract attention (contrast, movement), while repetition and proximity signal grouping (eg. a patch of algae).</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The designer aims to reduce complexity through clear visual cues, so even new users can quickly interpret the cause and effect. The choice to minimise text and maximise organic visual feedback keeps the UI open, playful, and explorable.</li>
    </ul>

   

    <h4>7 Poems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong>  Information is structured as discrete, isolated text fragments, spaced with generous whitespace and only revealed on cursor-down, using colour (highlighted/neutral) and contrast (appearing/disappearing) to visualise interactability.</li>
      <li><strong>Design Principle:</strong> Utilises progressive disclosure, where only the elements you interact with are revealed. Whitespace and alignment give each piece of text room to breathe, slowing reading and increasing user intention.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The designer’s logic is poetic, with information being earned, not given. The UI creates a sense of intimacy, inviting users to direct their own experience, uncovering subjective meaning.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Mapping</h3>

    <h4>Orb.Farm</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Adding water by “painting” it directly onto the tank changes the visible simulation. The mapping is consistent, where you click is where things happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Design Principle:</strong> Natural mapping: spatial actions produce accurate spatial results, reducing vagueness. The affordance is immediate, input and effect are linked both visually and physically.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> This transparency makes the system experiment-friendly, mistakes and discoveries both feel reasonable.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h4>7 Poems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Interacting with a line of poetry reveals a fragment, breaking linear flow and using mapping to create a sense of exploration or narrative surprise.</li>
      <li><strong>Design Principle:</strong> Metaphoric mapping: actions are mapped to user reveals, not fixed locations or physical models.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The mapping is interpretive and ambiguous, echoing the non-linear, subjective experience of reading a poem.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Characterisation</h3>

    <h4>Orb.Farm</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> The “character” of each species emerges through movement, behaviour, and visual context, predators dart, algae bloom, each with its own rhythm. Pixel art texture unifies style.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Character is emergent, not assigned, meaning comes from the system’s reaction, not an imposed narrative.</li>
    </ul>

   

    <h4>7 Poems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Characterisation happens through how words read and the harmony of sound, building in layers as the poem unfolds. Each fragment of text feels like it has an individual voice.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The UI treats text as performance, character emerges through interactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Feedback</h3>

    <h4>Orb.Farm</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Pouring too much salt makes water cloud instantly and orgnaisms die, a literal signal of error, no warning, just definite consequence.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong>  Immediate, predictable feedback teaches users the system’s logic through direct experience, with “real” ecology comes “real” outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h4>7 Poems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Clicking reveals new lines or cancels others, feedback is slow, gentle, and reversible.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Feedback is designed to be meditative, encouraging pause, reflection, and gentle exploration.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Both UIs embody their context: Orb.Farm’s is about accessible complexity and transparent systems, while 7 Poems is about poetic ambiguity and reader effect. The differences in information design, mapping, characterisation, and feedback are not just aesthetic, they reflect fundamentally different ideas of what an interface should be.</p>

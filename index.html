  <h1>Orb.Farm vs 7 Poems: Interaction Design Analysis</h1>
  <h2>UI research project – S4109866</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Information Design</h3>

    <h4>Orb.Farm</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> The state of the ecosystem is communicated primarily through colour (e.g., green for algae, tan for sand, blue for water), size (all materials are small but distinct shapes and movement), and proximity (clusters = relationships).</li>
      <li><strong>Design Principle:</strong> Leverages visual hierarchy (Soegaard): elements that change attract attention (contrast, movement), while repetition and proximity signal grouping (e.g., a patch of algae).</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The designer’s aim is mastering complexity through clear visual cues, so even a new user can quickly interpret cause and effect. The choice to minimise text and maximise organic visual feedback keeps the UI open, playful, and learnable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Contrast:</strong></p>

    <h4>7 Poems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Information is structured as discrete, isolated text fragments, spaced with generous whitespace and only revealed on cursor-down, using colour (highlighted vs. neutral) and contrast (appearing/disappearing) to visualise interactability.</li>
      <li><strong>Design Principle:</strong> Employs progressive disclosure: only what you interact with is revealed. Whitespace and alignment give each fragment room to breathe, slowing reading and heightening users’ intention.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The designer’s logic is poetic—information is earned, not given. The UI creates intimacy, inviting readers to compose their experience by uncovering subjective meaning.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Mapping</h3>

    <h4>Orb.Farm</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Adding water by “painting” on the tank directly changes the visible simulation. The mapping is 1:1—where you click is where things happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Design Principle:</strong> Natural mapping (Norman): spatial actions produce spatial results, reducing ambiguity. The affordance is immediate, control and effect are linked visually and physically.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> This transparency makes the system legible and experiment-friendly—mistakes and discoveries both feel reasonable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Direct contrast:</strong> Orb.Farm = literal, transparent mapping.</p>

    <h4>7 Poems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Interacting with a line of poetry reveals a fragment, breaking linear flow and using mapping to create a sense of exploration or narrative surprise.</li>
      <li><strong>Design Principle:</strong> Metaphoric mapping: actions are mapped to user reveals, not fixed locations or physical models.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The mapping is interpretive and ambiguous, echoing the non-linear, subjective experience of reading a poem.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Characterisation</h3>

    <h4>Orb.Farm</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> The “character” of each species emerges through movement, behaviour, and visual context—predators dart, algae bloom, each with its own rhythm. Pixel art texture unifies style.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Character is emergent, not assigned—meaning comes from the system’s performance, not an imposed narrative.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Direct contrast:</strong> Orb.Farm’s characters are ecosystem agents.</p>

    <h4>7 Poems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Characterisation happens through how words read and the harmony of sound, building in layers as the poem unfolds. Each fragment feels like it has its own voice.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The UI treats text as performance—character emerges through interactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Feedback</h3>

    <h4>Orb.Farm</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Pouring too much salt makes water cloud instantly and life-forms die, a high-contrast signal of error—no warning, just consequence.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Immediate, sometimes harsh feedback teaches users the system’s logic through direct experience—“real” ecology, “real” outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Direct contrast:</strong> Orb.Farm = immediate, visceral feedback.</p>

    <h4>7 Poems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Clicking reveals new lines or cancels others—feedback is slow, gentle, and reversible.</li>
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Feedback is designed to be meditative, encouraging pause, reflection, and gentle exploration.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Both UIs embody their context: Orb.Farm’s is about accessible complexity and transparent systems, while 7 Poems is about poetic ambiguity and reader agency. The differences in information design, mapping, characterisation, and feedback are not just aesthetic—they reflect fundamentally different philosophies about what an interface should be.</p>
